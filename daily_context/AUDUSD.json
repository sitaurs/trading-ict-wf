    "full_narrative": "**BAGIAN 1: COMPREHENSIVE TACTICAL ANALYSIS**\n\n**üîç HYPOTHESIS VALIDATION ASSESSMENT:**\nThe hypothesis of a bullish manipulation (upward Judas Swing) is strongly validated. The established Daily Bias is **BEARISH**, which dictates that the true institutional intent is to distribute (sell) positions. According to the Power of Three framework, this requires a preceding manipulation phase that moves *contrary* to the true intent. The expected pattern was a rally to sweep the Buy-Side Liquidity pool resting above the Asia High (defined at 0.65725).\n\nAnalysis of the provided market data confirms this sequence precisely:\n- **Timing Alignment:** The upward move initiated and culminated entirely within the London Killzone Critical Window (06:00 - 09:00 UTC).\n- **Directional Coherence:** The price action from 07:00 UTC to 08:00 UTC was a distinct rally, moving directly opposite to the established BEARISH daily bias.\n- **Boundary Breach:** The price decisively broke above the Asia High of 0.65725, reaching a peak of **0.65858** at the 08:00 UTC candle. This action successfully targeted the anticipated liquidity pool.\n\nThe observed price action is fully coherent with the bias-specific hypothesis (Scenario B), confirming the initial stage of a classic Judas Swing.\n\n**‚ö° MANIPULATION SIGNATURE CHARACTERIZATION:**\nThe observed move exhibits multiple classic signatures of an engineered liquidity sweep, not a genuine breakout:\n1.  **Velocity Profile:** The rally between 07:00 UTC and 08:00 UTC was impulsive and accelerated, characterized by a rapid price increase with significant tick volume expansion (e.g., 498 at 07:00, 452 at 08:00), indicative of institutional activity designed to trigger breakout algorithms and stop orders.\n2.  **Candle Formation & Rejection Signature:** The absolute peak of the move at **0.65858** (08:00 UTC candle) formed a textbook **shooting star/pin bar reversal**. This candle has a long upper wick (from 0.65858 down to a close of 0.65798), signifying a powerful injection of sell-side pressure that completely overwhelmed buying interest at the high. This is a primary signature of institutional distribution into engineered buying liquidity.\n3.  **Sustainability Failure:** Following the 08:00 UTC rejection, the price failed to sustain any level above the Asia High. The subsequent candles (08:15, 08:30, 08:45) were aggressively bearish, with the 08:30 candle showing a strong displacement downwards and closing well below the Asia High, confirming the artificial nature of the prior rally. The inability to consolidate or even retest the high is a hallmark of a manipulative move.\n\n**üéØ HTF ZONE INTERACTION DYNAMICS:**\nThe HTF Zone Target was designated as **N/A** for this analysis. Consequently, a direct assessment of price reaction to a pre-defined higher timeframe level of interest is not possible. In the absence of this specific confluence, the analytical weight shifts more heavily to the quality and character of the price action at the peak of the liquidity sweep itself. The observed rejection was not contingent on a specific HTF price level but was instead a function of the liquidity grab's completion. The powerful reversal signature (the 08:00 UTC shooting star) serves as the primary confirmation point, acting as a self-contained rejection zone created by the institutional order flow.\n\n**‚öñÔ∏è CONFIRMATION MATRIX SYNTHESIS:**\nThe synthesis of all analytical points leads to a definitive classification of the observed price action as an **authentic Judas Swing**.\n- **Key Supporting Evidence:**\n    1.  **Directional Inversity:** The bullish move was perfectly contrary to the BEARISH daily bias.\n    2.  **Precise Targeting:** The move successfully swept the Buy-Side Liquidity above the Asia High (0.65725).\n    3.  **Optimal Sweep Depth:** The penetration of **13.3 pips** (0.65858 - 0.65725) is within the optimal 2-15 pip range for an effective liquidity grab without signaling a genuine trend change.\n    4.  **Unmistakable Rejection:** The formation of a high-volume shooting star at the peak of the move is a high-conviction signal of institutional selling.\n    5.  **Immediate Reversal:** The subsequent price collapse confirms the manipulation and initiates the expected Distribution phase.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly refutes the possibility of a genuine breakout. The confidence level in this assessment is **HIGH**.\n\n**üö® RISK ASSESSMENT & TRADE IMPLICATIONS:**\nThe confirmation of an authentic Judas Swing validates the BEARISH trading thesis and signals that the optimal conditions for the Distribution phase are now in place.\n- **Tactical Implication:** The market is now primed for bearish continuation. The high of the Judas Swing (0.65858) serves as the new protective high for any short positions initiated during the distribution phase.\n- **Key Invalidation Level:** The entire manipulation thesis would be invalidated if the price were to rally again and achieve a sustained close with volume above the manipulation high of **0.65858**. This would indicate that the initial move was not a sweep but the first leg of a stronger, unforeseen bullish impulse.\n- **Contingency Planning:** Monitor for signs of bearish continuation, such as the formation of lower lows and lower highs, and breaks of immediate support structures formed after the reversal. Any failure to distribute downwards and a consolidation near the highs would increase the risk of a thesis invalidation.\n\n**BAGIAN 2: STRUCTURED DATA EXTRACTION**\n\nMANIPULATION_DETECTED: TRUE\nMANIPULATION_SIDE: ABOVE_ASIA_HIGH\nHTF_REACTION: FALSE\nCONFIDENCE_LEVEL: HIGH\nKEY_INVALIDATION_LEVEL: 0.65858",
